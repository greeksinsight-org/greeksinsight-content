# Ask Premium, Bid Premium, Total Premium, and Put/Call Ratio (Volume)

## 1. Introduction

Option **premiums** represent the **price paid** for the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying.  
The relationship between **bid**, **ask**, and **total premium flow** reflects **market aggressiveness, demand, and sentiment**.

The **Put/Call Volume Ratio**, when integrated with premium flows, adds deeper insight into **risk appetite** and **directional bias**.

## 2. Application

- **Bid Premiums**: Indicate passive limit orders — traders waiting for favorable prices.  
- **Ask Premiums**: Show aggressive buying — traders paying up for exposure.  
- **Total Premium** = Σ(Call Premiums + Put Premiums) across strikes and expirations.

The **Put/Call Premium Ratio** can be computed as:
> **PCR (Premium) = Total Put Premium / Total Call Premium**

Interpretation:
- Ratio < 1 → More call premium demand (bullish tone).  
- Ratio > 1 → More put premium demand (bearish tone).  

Combining volume and premium ratios provides a **multi-layered sentiment model**, revealing whether traders are **actively buying or selling** exposure.
