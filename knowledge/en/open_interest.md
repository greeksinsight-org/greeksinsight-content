# Open Interest — Calls & Puts

## 1. Introduction

**Open Interest (OI)** represents the **total number of outstanding option contracts** that remain open and have not been exercised or closed.  
Unlike volume, which measures daily activity, OI measures **the size and persistence of market positions**.

Tracking call and put OI across strikes gives insight into **market sentiment**, **dealer exposure**, and **potential support/resistance levels** created by large positions.

## 2. Application

### 2.1. Interpreting Open Interest

- **Rising OI with rising price** → New long positions; confirms trend strength.  
- **Rising OI with falling price** → New short positions; bearish conviction.  
- **Falling OI** → Position closing or profit-taking, signaling trend exhaustion.

### 2.2. Call vs Put OI

- **High Call OI above spot** → Indicates potential resistance (dealers short calls).  
- **High Put OI below spot** → Suggests potential support (dealers short puts).  
These levels often act as **Gamma Walls**, influencing dealer hedging and intraday movement.

### 2.3. OI Changes and Expirations

Monitoring daily changes in OI helps identify **new exposure** versus **closing flows**. Large OI buildup before expiration can **anchor prices** around key strikes, known as **pinning**.

## 3. Key Takeaways

- Open Interest shows **commitment** and **liquidity depth**.  
- Combine OI with **volume** and **GEX** to interpret positioning.  
- Large OI clusters mark **psychological and mechanical barriers**.  
- Sharp OI drops post-expiry often trigger volatility resets.
