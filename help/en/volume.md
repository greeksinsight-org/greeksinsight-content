# Options Volume

## 1. Introduction

**Options volume** represents the number of contracts traded during a specific session.  
It reflects **trader activity**, **sentiment**, and **short-term liquidity** in the options market.  
Analyzing call and put volume helps identify whether traders are leaning bullish, bearish, or neutral.

## 2. Application

- **High Call Volume**: Indicates bullish speculation or hedging against short positions.  
- **High Put Volume**: Suggests bearish sentiment or protection buying.  
- **Volume Spikes**: Often precede volatility events or directional moves.

Traders often look for:
> **Put/Call Volume Ratio = Total Put Volume / Total Call Volume**

Interpretation:
- Ratio < 1 → More call buying (bullish bias).  
- Ratio > 1 → More put buying (bearish bias).

Combining **volume trends** with **open interest** shows whether new positions are being **opened** or **closed**, improving signal accuracy.

- Rising call volume = bullish tone; rising put volume = defensive tone.  
- Use in combination with **open interest** and **implied volatility** for best context.
